# Zlib on DPU

Port of Zlib for a DPU-based solution.

## Contents

- `Makefile` compile and build executables
- `zlib` contains the original zlib library
- `host_simple_example.c` contains a host harnest:
- `dpu_decompress.c` the dpu entry point for decompression
- `common` sources required for all dpu programs
- `decompress` sources required for decompression on the dpu

## How to build

- Make sure to build the zlib library following the appropriate instructions which are found in `zlib/Makefile.in`
- run `make`

## How to run
- The executable we're using is `host_driver`, it should be generated when you run make
- Usage: `host_driver --cpu/dpu --compress/decompress <inputfile> <outputfile>`
